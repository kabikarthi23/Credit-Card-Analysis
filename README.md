# 💳 Credit Card Strategy & Consumer Insights Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on a strategic market analysis for a financial institution aiming to launch a new line of credit cards. By analyzing a massive dataset of **864,000+ transaction records** and 4,000 customer profiles, I identified the "Ideal Customer Profile" and designed a data-backed product roadmap to maximize adoption and retention.

### 🎯 Business Goals
* **Market Segmentation:** Identify high-value demographics for targeted marketing.
* **Usage Analysis:** Find the "Average Income Utilization %" to predict creditworthiness.
* **Feature Engineering:** Recommend product features (cashback, rewards, security) based on actual spending behaviors.

## 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
* **Excel:** Initial data exploration and data dictionary verification.
* **Power Query (ETL):** Handled **864,000+ rows** of spend data—performed data cleaning, removed duplicates, and optimized data types for performance.
* **Power BI:** Developed a 2-page interactive dashboard for stakeholders.
* **DAX & Data Modeling:** Established a **Star Schema** for efficient reporting and created measures for key KPIs.
